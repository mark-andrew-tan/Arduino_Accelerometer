# Arduino Accelerometer

### Background
This is a follow-up project based on the PHYS 159 lab of creating an ohmmeter using only resistors and a voltmeter.

### Project Goal
Build a device that will measure my physical performance on squats.

### Hardware 
- Arduino UNO
- Servo motor
- Sonar sensor

### Design
The servo motor had an arm attached that would act as the analog display.

The components would be attached to a cardboard box enclosing and strapped to a belt around my waist.
